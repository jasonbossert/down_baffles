# Down Baffle Design

There is a large community of outdoor enthusiasts dedicated to making their own ultralight down sleeping quilts. These quilts have internal baffles that keep the down evenly distributed throughout the quilt. This [notebook](notebooks/baffles.ipynb) looks at the design of these internal baffles, taking into account deformation of the baffles from the ideal rectangular shape. Wide, shallow baffles have large deformations, leading to thermal inefficiency, while narrow, deep baffles require large amounts of extra material. We find the optimal baffle design.
